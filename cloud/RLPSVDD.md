# Time Series Anomaly Detection for Trustworthy Services in Cloud Computing Systems

## Abstract

As a powerful architecture for large-scale computation, cloud computing has revolutionized the way that computing infrastructure is abstracted and utilized. Coupled with the challenges caused by Big Data, the rocketing development of cloud computing boosts the complexity of system management and maintenance, resulting in weakened trustworthiness of cloud services. To cope with this problem, a compelling method, i.e., Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), is investigated in this paper for detecting anomalous performance metrics of cloud services. Although competent in general anomaly detection, SVDD suffers from unsatisfactory false alarm rate and computational complexity in time series anomaly detection, which considerably hinders its practical applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a relaxed form of linear programming SVDD (RLPSVDD) and presents important insights into parameter selection for practical time series anomaly detection in order to monitor the operations of cloud services. Experiments on the Iris dataset and the Yahoo benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approaches. Furthermore, the comparison of RLPSVDD and the methods obtained from Twitter, Numenta, Etsy and Yahoo, shows the overall preference for RLPSVDD in time series anomaly detection.
