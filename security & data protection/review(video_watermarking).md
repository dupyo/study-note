# Video Watermarking Techniques : A Review

Abstract 

Digital watermarking is meant to protect the digital information from unauthorized agencies or person. 
Internet has opened a new door to share their thoughts, text , images and video. 
This makes it possible to manipulate and redistribute these information illegally. 
Video watermarking is another variant of digital watermarking which is used for video authentication and for other purpose. 
This paper presents a review work in video watermarking research field.

Introduction

Sharing of information now a days has become common among the agencies and people across the world. Introduction of 3G and 4G network for high speed communication, emergence of social media like facebook, Twitter to Wats up application in mobile enable the people to share information 24/7. Sharing the information from other has posed a problem of data tempering and later on republishing it in some other name. These problems motivated the researchers to design some algorithm to put an stop to such practice by incorporating some security to the digital content. Digital watermarking is the outcome of this effort. A Digital watermark is basically an ownership information which is embedded in digital information to protect it from unauthorised access. Digital video watermarking is just the enhanced version of digital image watermarking. Digital video is a sequence of consecutive still images known as frames. The amount of information which is embedded in information is known as the payload. Unlike image watermarking, video watermarking also address the problem of large volume. Watermark embedding algorithm hide the watermark directly to the host media (image/video) or to the transformed version of host media. In transform domain watermarking approach, frames of the video is converted to frequency domain using some frequency domain conversion methodology and then watermark is embedded in transfer domain media. Once the watermark is embedded then the host signal is again converted back to pixel domain. Discrete Cosine transform (DCT)[2,3], discrete wavelet transform[4] are some common method of transform domain. In case of spatial domain watermarking process, transformation take place directly on the pixel of video frames. Transform domain model of watermarking is also useful in audio watermarking [3,4]. 

This paper is divided in to 5 different sections. Section II described some common term or properties of watermark and its significance in video watermarking.
Section III list various application of watermarking while the section IV present a some noteworthy contribution suggested in video watermarking by several authors.
